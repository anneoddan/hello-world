# hello-world
##Hi! Welcome to my page!
** I am a dedicated and versatile professional with a strong background in business analytics, finance, and leadership. Currently pursuing dual B.B.A. degrees in Business Analytics and Information Systems, and Finance at the University of Iowaâ€™s Tippie College of Business, I have honed my skills through various roles. 
As the Pool Director at Martha Burns Swim School, I managed operations and led a team of over 55 lifeguards, ensuring safety and exceptional customer service. My experience as a Competitive Swim Coach for GMMO Swim Team allowed me to design training programs and organize large-scale swim meets. Additionally, I have served as an Alpine Ski Instructor, sharing my passion for skiing with students of all ages. In leadership roles, such as Director of Finances for Pi Beta Phi and Treasurer for the Society of Human Resource Management, I have demonstrated my ability to manage finances and contribute to organizational success. My diverse experiences reflect my commitment to excellence and my ability to adapt and thrive in various environments.
